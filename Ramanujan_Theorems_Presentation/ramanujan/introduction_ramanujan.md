## Introduction
Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887–1920), a self-taught genius from India, revolutionized number theory with his work on infinite series and modular forms. This document connects his life to five computational notebooks. See the [merged PDF](../html/Ramanujan_Theorems_Presentation.pdf) for a combined view.

## Early Life and Self-Taught Mastery
Born in Erode, Tamil Nadu, Ramanujan mastered trigonometry by 13. Using G.S. Carr’s *Synopsis of Elementary Results*, he developed novel series. The [Ramanujan’s Pi Series notebook](../ramanujan/01_Ramanujan_Pi.ipynb) ([HTML](../html/01_Ramanujan_Pi.html) | [PDF](../html/01_Ramanujan_Pi.pdf)) implements his π formulas, achieving 14+ digits per term.

## Breakthrough and Collaboration with G.H. Hardy
Ramanujan’s 1913 letter to G.H. Hardy led to a Cambridge collaboration. Their work is explored in:
- [Partition Function notebook](../ramanujan/02_Partition_Function.ipynb) ([HTML](../html/02_Partition_Function.html) | [PDF](../html/02_Partition_Function.pdf)): Computes p(n) with <0.1% error.
- [Continued Fractions notebook](../ramanujan/03_Continued_Fraction.ipynb) ([HTML](../html/03_Continued_Fraction.html) | [PDF](../html/03_Continued_Fraction.pdf)): Evaluates the Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction.

## Final Years and the "Lost Notebook"
Ramanujan’s final year produced mock theta functions, detailed in the [Mock Theta Functions notebook](../ramanujan/05_Mock_Theta_Functions.ipynb) ([HTML](../html/05_Mock_Theta_Functions.html) | [PDF](../html/05_Mock_Theta_Functions.pdf)).

The [Tau Function notebook](../ramanujan/04_Tau_Function.ipynb) ([HTML](../html/04_Tau_Function.html) | [PDF](../html/04_Tau_Function.pdf)) computes τ(n), plotting its oscillatory growth.

## Legacy and Modern Impact
Ramanujan’s work influences string theory and cryptography. These notebooks showcase his formulas’ computational power.
